various scraping utilities written in python, copyright 2014 qt

published under the GNU GPL version 3, see LICENSE.md for details

using the scripts:

	run via the commandline with "python program_name.py 'url' 'folder to save images to'", note that if you use GNU/Linux youll need to type python3 instead of just python
	gelbooru.py now has multi page support, which means that for gelbooru youll need to add the number of pages you want to scrape to the end of the command

	supports gif, png, jpeg and jpg extensions and is case insensetive
	obviously you need python to use this
	DO NOT end the folder string with a backslash

planned for the future:
	a windows GUI for the plebs out there :^)

	a yaoiheaven scraper

	multipage support for xhamster (not really a priority unless somebody asks for it)
